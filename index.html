<h1>Let's build a page</h1>

<p>
  We will be modifying the index.html and css/style.scss to learn the how to design and add content
  to a website. Do not worry about other files, although we encourage exploration on your own time.
</p>


<p>
  Fork this repo and add your own code and resources to personalize it.

<h2>Reference guides</h2>

<p>
  Nothing like some <span>Google Foo</span> to figure out what is wrong. At times you will
  find certain pages that will consistently provide the best information.
</p>

<p>
  <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/" target="_blank">W3 Schools</a> is one of the most
  widely use pages, it has a we rounded reference for many web languages and technologies.
</p>

<p>
  <a href="https://github.com/">Github</a> is certainly the place to look for when searching software
  overall, from giants like facebook to individuals contributing to the community. Heck, this page
  is hosted by Github. So check them out.
</p>

<p>
  When I need to deepdive into a reference and find every detail it is best to go to
  <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/">Mozilla Developer Network</a> it is similar to W3 Schools
  but in my experience they go out of their way to <span>"bother"</span> us with the minor details.
  Also they are adamant on keeping up to date and providing the most accurate information.
